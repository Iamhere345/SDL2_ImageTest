# SDL2 Image Test

Small project i made in a day or two while loosely following a tutorial to get a window working and displaying an image (in this case a well-known windows XP wallpaper).

## Building and running

This was originally designed to run on osx with SDL2 installed as a framework. If you have those two things, you can build this by running `build.sh`. Otherwise you will have to compile it another way. I beleive on linux you can do `g++ -w -lsdl2 -o main` or something like that. You may have to change the `#include <SDL2/SDL.h>` statement as well.
